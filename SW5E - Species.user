  <thing id="rPRBith" name="Bith" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nBith are craniopods with pale pink, yellow, or green skin, large heads, large lidless eyes, toeless feet, and long fingers. Their thumb and small finger were both fully opposable. The bith’s internal systems are different from most humanoids, as the bith have only one lung, and exhale through their skin. Bith also lack a proper nose, instead having highly sensitive olfactory organs hidden in the skin-flaps of their cheeks.\n\nThe other bith senses are also acute. Bith can sense the tonal qualities of sound as well as other species sensed colors. Their eyes, as big as a Menahuun’s, can see microscopic details of nearby objects, but are extremely nearsighted as a result. An interesting side effect of their incredible sensors is the effect of sonic grenades, or screamers, on them. It is described as causing their heads to explode. Similarly, bith have high manual dexterity which helps them manipulate fine tools, though their physical prowess with gross motor skills was only average.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nBith are one of the galaxy’s most ancient civilizations, with a history going back millions of years. This antiquity garners respect in certain quarters, such as among the Gree, who gave them more respect than other, “younger” species. Their society is highly regimented, with everything from mate selection to political leadership controlled by sophisticated computer programs.\n\nNAMES\nBith names are quite diverse. Some names look complicated and difficult to pronounce, while others are quite simple.\n\nMale Names. Fedu, Jenkiss, Kabadons, Ph’teumkiass\n\nFemale Names.

  <thing id="rPRBothan" name="Bothan" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nBothans are a short species of furry humanoids. Bothans are covered in fur which shifted in response to their emotional state by way of gentle ripplings. It is this trait, named Wrendui, that betrays them when members of their kind intend to be duplicitous in their dealings with others. They possess tapered pointed ears, and both males and females were known to sport beards.\n\nBothans are able to interbreed with the other species, though it is rare that they do so. Such hybrids somewhat resembled baseline humans with haunches, hooves, fur, pointed ears and a long tail.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nBothan culture is guided by the philosophy and principles from the ancient text known as The Way, written by Golm Fervse’dra. In this “Bothan Way”, the pursuit of power and influence is paramount. Thus, individual bothans put their own political and economic success above all other concerns, and as a species, bothans put their own advancement ahead of other intergalactic interests. The volume of backstabbing, subtle character assassination and political maneuvering in bothan society is dizzying, and results in many species stereotyping bothans as untrustworthy. In fact, most bothans are habitually paranoid, believing that anyone who’s not working with them, is working against them. In times of crisis, the focus of bothan society shifts to a survivalist state known as “ar’krai”. When engaged in ar’krai, all fit bothans volunteer to defend their species from impending extinction.\n\nNAMES\nMale bothan names are often trickey while female’s are soft. Surnames are familial.\n\nMale Names. Garc, Hibriak, Nith, Tramom, Ventagt\n\nFemale Names. Ceerriah, Dhaim, Gnam, Meenn, Vit\n\nSurnames. Bwif’livi, Gra’kit, Hia’faitu, Main’dil" compset="Race">

Typically well-muscled, the abyssin’s stooping gait results in a slightly hunched appearance.\n\nA distinctive trait of the abyssin is their ability to heal quickly; their fast regeneration is believed to have been an adaptation to prevent fluid loss via bleeding on their desert homeworld. All cells in the abyssin body are replaced every 80 hours, and organs which typically were paired in other species appear singularly.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nA primitive tribal society, the abyssin of Byss are known as violent and brutish, and their planet is avoided by most beings in the civilized galaxy. Unstable resources on Byss do not allow for mass population growth or for the stabilization of a central government, economy or trade system.\n\nExisting simply in nomadic tribes, abyssin groups can interact peacefully with one another, though only if both groups have plentiful water and food supplies. Otherwise, they began a ‘Blooding’, a brawl that ends only when one tribe’s warriors are all killed, captured, or incapacitated. Warriors who survive a Blooding are usually allowed to join the winning tribe once they finish their regeneration. This tradition led to some violent incidents when spacers tried to make first contact and trade with Abyssin tribes with scarce water resources, especially since the abyssin assumed the alien traders could regenerate as quickly as they did.\n\nNAMES\nThere does not appear to be any distinction between male and female names for abyssin. Abyssin don’t use surnames.\n\nNames. Anami, Easym, Myo, Qawohl, Seh-run, Sidie" compset="Race">

  <thing id="rPRAdvozse" name="Advozse" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nAdvozsec evolved from herbivorous reptile-analogs which fed on the vegetation known to form around Riflor’s hot springs. Evolving into a class of reptomammal, advozsec have a single horn at the crown of their heads, four digits on each hand and foot, pointed ears, and large eyes. Advozsec are strictly vegetarian, unable to properly digest meat. The geothermal hot springs that appear on their homeworld forced the species to evolve thick skin in order to survive. The large eyes of the advozsec are adaptations to the clouds of volcanic ash which darken Riflor’s skies.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nSince so much of the sunlight on Riflor is blocked by volcanic eruptions, advozsec tend to settle near geothermal springs for heat. Unfortunately, these springs also tend to be in geologically unstable regions, and anything built near them is often destroyed or abandoned due to eruptions or groundquakes. As a result, the advozse people ended up having little attachment to material goods or long-term plans, and developed a pessimistic, selfish, and even paranoid outlook on life. This facet of their culture remained long after contact with the Galactic Republic gave them access to modern construction techniques allowing for more permanent buildings. Seeing financial stability as the only truly achievable stability one could find in life, the advozsec constantly strive to accumulate as much monetary wealth as they can in a lifetime in order to have the ability to rebuild when the worst happens.\n\nNAMES\nAdvozsec have simple names that do not distinguish between genders, using familiar surnames.\n\nFirst Names.

Their bodies also possess rapid healing abilities. These traits make them the perfect hand-to-hand specialists.\n\nThe Cathar species also has two subspecies, known as the Juhani and the Myr Rho. Both of these are notably less catlike than mainline Cathar. Cathar are born into a litter. The Cathar species is biologically similar to the Bothan species.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nOn their homeworld, Cathar live in cities built into giant trees, and are organized into clans governed by elders. Stories of their great heroes were often carved into the trunks of these tree-homes for following generations to see. The Cathar mate for life, to the extent that when one mate dies, the survivor never has a relationship with another. Cathar clan society includes great pageants and celebrations, especially for their heroes. Their religion includes a ritual known as the “Blood Hunt,” in which Cathar warriors individually engaged in combat against entire nests of Kiltik in order to gain honor and purge themselves of inner darkness. The native language of the Cathar is Catharese, which included the emphasis of some spoken words with a growl.\n\nNAMES\nCathar names can sound both melodic and fairly gutteral, but they almost always sound strong and fierce.

The aing-tii head is small and juts out perpendicularly from their chest, featuring two large eyes and six long, thin, green tongues extending from their mouths. They have a long, prehensile tail. The species is incapable of producing sound and conveys information via tasting, smelling and touching each other with their tongues.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe aing-tii are native to a planet whose location in the Kathol Rift is a closely guarded secret. Although in a dangerous area of space, the majority of Aing-Tii never leave their homeworld nor have any contact with the outside world. Those who do�commonly called aing-tii warrior monks�are often xenophobic and reclusive. The monks spend their entire lives performing errands for their gods, in the hope that they will receive “an answer” from them. The aing-tii hate slavery, and often attack slavers who roam the Kathol Outback.\n\nWhile the aing-tii are Force-sensitive, they avoid wielding the Force, which they see as sacred.

It also enables them to process information and solve problems rapidly and provides a highly advanced capacity for concentration and meditation. Because of their thoughtful nature, they tend to be calm, rational and analytical, preferring peaceful philosophies and a lifestyle which works in harmony with nature. Though the quick-thinking Cereans have equally quick reflexes, they are commonly not as well coordinated as humans.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nCereans developed a low-tech society on their homeworld and prefer to live in isolation from the wider galaxy. Preserving the natural beauty of Cerea, the planet is home to many Outsider Citadels where it is permissible to use offworld technology, though it could not be removed from the Citadel. Meditation is a core part of a Cerean’s daily rituals, with many employing specially-forged kasha crystals as a focusing tool.

Their blue skin, jet black hair and red eyes generally command attention; these features make them physically striking and instantly recognizable.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nChiss society is highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being enforced by a group of four affiliations known as the Ruling Families: the Csapla, Nuruodo, Inrokini and Sabosen. These are not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their government. Every chiss claims affiliation to one of the four families, as determined by both tradition and place of birth. The family names are more of a cultural holdover; the bloodlines had grown so co-meddled that any chiss could claim affiliation to any of the ruling families. In spite of the outward impression of calm and order that the chiss like to project to outsiders, there were evidently tensions within the Families; political assassinations are a real part of chiss political life for the Ruling Families.\n\nNAMES\nA chiss true-name has 3 parts, each separated by an apostrophe.

Their bodies are denser than most humanoids’ and as a result they were heavier than their appearance would tend to indicate. Devaronians have silver-based blood, which appears thick and black when exposed. They possess a unique blood filtration and cleansing system which processes through two livers. Because their bodies are constantly cleansed of toxins and carcinogens, the species is highly resistant to poison. To this end, sulfur is used as a stimulant on Devaron to enhance speed and strength, because inhaling it causes the substance to enter the bloodstream rapidly. Their livers struggle to eliminate sulfur from their system, meaning that long-term use can be dangerous.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nDevaronian males are driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the first opportunity to move on from one place to another; they are often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts. Female Devaronians, on the other hand, are content to remain in a single location, raising the young and running the government of Devaron. The males send money back to their homeworld to support their families, but otherwise hardly ever return.

Olfactory organs beneath their eyes are responsible for their sense of smell. Both females and males are bald, though both genders are easily distinguished. Their large red goggle-like eyes have slit pupils. Duros females lay eggs as they are descended from ancient reptiles, and they are born in a larval grub stage. Unlike similar species, the duros take care of their offspring from birth.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nTheir home planet Duro is primarily uninhabited due to massive pollution on the world over time. Instead, it is covered with automated farms for food production. The duros live in twenty orbital space cities above the planet.\n\nThe duros also established a vast, grand starship construction industry in the Duro system. The duros set up their government around a consortium of starship construction corporations, with all important political decisions made by the stockholders of the corporations. This meant that any duros that held stock in a company could participate in the administration of the system.\n\nWith their strong memories, some duros also choose to become extraordinary storytellers, renowned galaxy-wide for their ability to learn a wide range of narratives by heart, and perform them all with stunning accuracy.\n\nNAMES\nDuros names are generally melodic, with female names having softer intonations. Surnames are familial.\n\nMale Names. Cir, Fod, Mom, Rur, Zim\n\nFemale Names. Chochi, Fumsu, Kaleshef, Raada\n\nSurnames. Dektuks, Jimoks, Silt, Tuzig, Zhoks" compset="Race">

Their appearance has been likened to “little bears,” though they are sometimes referred to as “mini Wookiees.”\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nMost Ewoks live high among the trees of the forest moon, in villages built between the closely spaced trees. The basic design of a tree village has a “Central Village” of thatched-roof huts on the primary limbs. These huts are high enough above the ground to be out of reach of predators. Suspended bridges connect the gaps between trees, adjoining distant huts. Knotted rope ladders allow access up or down.\n\nEwoks enjoy singing and playing music during celebrations and rituals. They are resourceful and tend to make use of everything they get their hands on; they use a variety of crude drums, horns, flutes, and other instruments in their music.\n\nNAMES\nEwok names are comprised of growled consonants. Female names always end in a vowel. Surnames are clan-based.\n\nMale Names. Coostick, Erphek, Grarphil, Moodoo\n\nFemale Names. Booshi, Chela, Fesasha, Lipe, Ypezzi\n\nSurnames.

Most gamorreans have a dark greenish coloration over a large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration does vary, particularly among females, with light skinned and two-toned pigmentation not uncommon. Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white pigmentation are possible. Males tended to have less skin variation and had a greater tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varied evenly between gold-yellow, blue, black and brown. The gamorreans generally put no importance on skin or eye coloration although there were some superstitions linked to certain markings.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nGamorreans are organized into clans ruled by a male warlord and his wife, who was the most powerful of the clan matrons. While the warlord and his boars are solely concerned with preparing and participating in battle with rival clans, the matrons of the clan performed all the productive work including farming, hunting, manufacturing, and running businesses. Since the amount of available arable land on Gamorr is scarce, clans often lay claim to the same piece of land, and they spend their time fighting over possession.\n\nNAMES\nGamorrean names are very gutteral and rough. Male names are typically one syllable while females are two. Surnames are based on clan affiliation rather than family.\n\nMale Names. Ark, Blarrp, Blubrak, Cuab, Shos\n\nFemale Names.

Strong leg muscles allow for powerful and quick frog-kick style swimming through water as well as a remarkable jumping ability while on land. Fin-like ears (called haillu) also aid them in swimming, as well as expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and fear. They have partially retractable eyestalks with nictitating membranes when underwater. Green eyes are unusual amongst Gungans.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nGungans are generally a generous and peaceful species. They truly love to have visitors and warmly welcome them; however, they would remain suspicious until the visitors have earned their respect. Gungans are not tolerant of anyone who threatens their peaceful culture. They have very strict laws, and will go to the extremes to punish anyone who has committed a minor crime. Vandals, for example, can be given a sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning.\n\nIf a Gungan is cast out of society, it is very difficult for them to return. If they do manage to return legally, they are often subjected to heavy discrimination. This can make life very difficult for them and can go on for months or years, until their past offenses disappear from memory. Returning back to the settlement they were exiled from illegally will sometimes result in the death penalty, especially if they brought along outsiders.\n\nNAMES\nGungan names are often repeated syllables hyphenated.\n\nMale Names.

Their bodies are comprised of a torso with a head and four limbs attached to it. The upper limbs, or arms, end in hands which had five fingers each; the lower ones, called legs, end in feet. The human fingers have multiple points of articulation, and one of them is an opposable thumb that allowed for fine manipulation. Finally, they have one head perched atop their torso. Many other species, including twi’leks, mon calamari, or zabraks, are referred to as “humanoids” because of their structural resemblance to humans.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nHumans can occupy a variety of employs, from politicians to bounty hunters, swoop racers, smugglers, or even a farmer.

Their reflexes and coordination are somewhat slower than that of average humanoids.\n\nIn addition to allowing them to speak their unique stereophonic language, the Ithorians’ four throats also have the ability to violently expel air, resulting in a deafening and potentially concussive scream. Despite this fact, most Ithorians go their entire lives without ever resorting to violence, and so the ability remained relatively ambiguous.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nIthorians worship the “Mother Jungle,” a spiritual entity embodying the lush, tropical ecology of their world, Ithor. They are generally devoted environmentalists, staunch herbivores, and complete pacifists, devoting much time to contemplating their ecology, studying plants and their uses and the overall respecting of all living things. Most Ithorians never set foot on their own planet, instead living in floating cities above their world called herdships. Only three of their continents have been explored and harvested, the other two never having been touched by Ithorian hands. They demonstrate extreme belief in the protection and sustaining of their environment as dictated by their “Law of Life.”\n\nNAMES\nIthorian names are quite varied in length but most names are soft and melodic.

  <thing id="rPRJawa" name="Jawa" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nJawas are easily identifiable by their traditional brown hooded robes, though it is not unheard of for them to wear other colors. Other notable features included their glowing yellow eyes, small stature and high pitched, quickly spoken language called Jawaese. Underneath their robes, jawas appear to be gaunt, rodent-like creatures, with shrunken faces and yellow eyes.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nJawas are a communal, compulsive scavenger species who spend most of their life devoted to scavenging the deserts of Tatooine in search of any scrap metal, droid or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star travel and technological advancement. Most non-jawas regard the jawas as scavengers and thieves, a description that most jawas actually find pleasing.\n\nThe jawa’s unofficial motto is not to look for uses in a salvaged item, but rather to imagine someone else who might find a use for it. This is evidenced in their endless search for wares with which to trade with almost any being jawas encounter. They have a kind of instinctive feel for machinery and electronics, notorious for knowing how to get a piece of equipment functioning just well enough to sell.\n\nNAMES\nJawa names are quickly spoken, complex, and often misunderstood. Jawas who spend the majority of their time around other species respond well to nicknames. Male and female names do not significantly deviate. Surnames are clan based.\n\nMale names.

The females are distinguished from the males by their more prominent chest areas.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe mon calamari have developed a very advanced and civilized culture. Their art, music, literature, and science show a creativity surpassed by few in the galaxy.

An egg-laying species, Nautolans emerge from their egg as a tadpole that develops arms, legs, and head-tails during their second year of life. Roughly the same size as a Human infant during this time, their limbs are weak and unable to support their weight, forcing youthful Nautolans to remain in aquatic environments for much of their childhood.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe society developed by the Nautolans on Glee Anselm is centralized around local families and governments. The centralized government of Glee Anselm is comprised of representatives from the Council of Elders that govern each settlement. Elders are elected on merit, and can be made up of youthful politicians as well as the most aged members of the society. A culture that promotes life-long mates, Nautolan families are characterized by their loyalty between spouses and the equality of the sexes in the household.

The flexible snouts augmented the rodians’ finely tuned olfactory senses, collecting and filtering the air. Their characteristically large eyes indicated a primarily nocturnal ancestry and were capable of seeing into the infrared part of the spectrum. Due to their love of fighting and active lifestyles, most rodians kept in good condition, normally lean and wiry; however, some wealthy rodians became complacent and obese.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nRodian culture is obsessed with violence and death, due to behaviors and practices that are ingrained since their earliest ancestry. Their densely packed jungle homeworld is ill-suited for agriculture, requiring rodians to compete with vicious predators for most of their food, some of which can wipe out entire rodian villages. As the rodians developed cunning hunting tactics to survive, the hunt became central to their culture.

Sith have a larger than average number of individuals with potential to use the Force in their species, so high in fact that the entire species was considered strongly Force-sensitive.\n\nSith purebloods are characterized by their expressive facial appendages, bone spurs, cranial horns, and predatory gaze.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nSith culture is a rigid and stratified caste-based society. For the sith, war and violence are just as much a part of the natural order of life as peace or serenity. Though they are in an almost constant state of war, their civilization is quite sophisticated; they see these acts not as cruel or barbaric, but simply basic aspects of existence. Their constant warring led to a dwindling of the population on their original homeworld of Korriban as well as cultivated an intensely xenophobic society.\n\nNAMES\nSith pureblood names are not conventional. They are often named for virtues in the Sith tongue. Sith rarely share surnames, since they do not value family ties. When a sith pureblood achieves a success or victory, they often change their name to match their perceived newfound status. Since Force-sensitivity is common in sith purebloods, and their culture is built around strength, most sith are called simply “My Lord,” or some other epithet, by their underlings.\n\nMale Names.

This red and white pattern was a phenotype left over from their ancestor’s camouflage that helped them to blend in with Shili’s natural surroundings.\n\nTheir heads bear two montrals, with three to four head-tails, whose stripes were darker than those of the montrals. Togruta have the ability to sense the proximity and movement of physical objects around them by means of their hollow montrals, which detect space ultrasonically. Young togrutas’ montrals and posterior head-tail do not fully grow until adolescence, when their montrals curve and their final head-tail grows to the length of their other head-tails.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nTogruta have a strong sense of unity and togetherness. On their native homeworld of Shili, they rely on each other and band together to take a stand against the massive monsters that hunt them. The creatures of Shili most often attack in groups, which was even more reason for the native togruta to work together. While most of Shili is covered in the scrublands where the togruta hunt their herbivorous prey, the togruta live in small communities in the forest valleys.\n\nNAMES\nTogruta names are typically long. Surnames are familial.\n\nMale Names. Acanaar, Mukraas, Obolak, Tokrym\n\nFemale Names. Akoma, Maasha, Okohlo, Shola\n\nSurnames. Hyl, Na, Nim, Ris, Resh, Vaal, Zin" compset="Race">

  <thing id="rPRTrandoshan" name="Trandoshan" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nTrandoshans are a large, bipedal sentient species, with scaly skin which was shed roughly once every standard year and was thought to be very durable. Cold-blooded reptiles, trandoshans had two super-sensitive varied color eyes with horizontal black pupils, which could see far into the infrared range. Each of their four limbs ends in three razor sharp claws. These are perfect for combat, but did not grant them manual dexterity, making a trandoshan’s finger movements somewhat clumsy and awkward.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nTrandoshans worship their goddess, the Scorekeeper, whom they would appease through acts which increased their Jagannath points. This is done by living a lifestyle which was, by non-trandoshan standards, overtly aggressive, leading many trandoshans to become bounty hunters, mercenaries, or slavers. Trandoshans especially prize wookiee pelts, which consequently play a large part in earning Jagannath points-capturing the pelts of particularly infamous wookiees would give the hunter a large increase in Jagganath points. To be shamed or captured during a hunt would zero one’s Jagganath points-effectively making their life forfeit in the eyes of the Scorekeeper. They could, however, win all those points back by killing the one who zeroed their score.\n\nNAMES\nTrandoshan names are quite harsh and contain a lot of elongated sounds, as well as a lot of s’s. Differences between male and female names are often very subtle, but there is a higher chance for female names to contain softer sounds.\n\nMale Names.

From birth, Tuskens are covered in wraps, and, barring very rare occasions, will not bare any part of their skin in sight of another person. This, combined with their hostility to outsiders and Tatooine’s remote and arid nature, makes even study of Tusken corpses difficult.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nTuskens are a primative, tribal race, mostly living in small clans scattered throughout Tatooine’s deserts. Due to the harsh and unforgiving desert environment, Tusken clans are often xenophobic and territorial, but it is not unknown for them to adopt members of other species into the clan. They believe that all water is sacred and promised to them alone, and are infamous among the other residents of Tatooine for raiding and pillaging settlements and farms.\n\nTusken clans are usually very stratified, with males as hunters and warriors, while females and children maintain the camp. Tusken warriors hold their bond with their gaderffii weapons and Bantha mounts as sacred, and will choose death before relinquishing either.\n\nNAMES\nTusken naming traditions vary between clans, but most are made up of harsh, guttural sounds.

When traveling off their homeworld, twi’leks rarely refuse food, which frequently leads to obesity among starfarers. Twi’lek society also considers obesity as a sign of influence and success.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe natural grace and exotic beauty of the female twi’leks make them a popular target among slave traders. Slavery is the main currency of Ryloth. Some see it as a chance to make money by kidnapping or selling orphaned children, while others see slavery as a way of saving children from growing up in Ryloth’s harsh environment. A number of twi’leks believe that slavery is an efficient way to proliferate their species and preserve their culture, as the twi’leks lack their own means of inter-planetary travel. Regardless of how it came about, many twi’leks live as slaves or entertainers and are considered status symbols, especially the females of rarer skin hues. Twi’leks that manage to escape from captivity usually turned to a life of thievery or prostitution, with both genders making use of their powers of seduction.\n\nNAMES\nTwi’lek names combine their first name and a clan name into a single name, rather than having a separate surname.\n\nMale Names.

Their faces are lipless, with a frill along each of their jowls.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nWeequays have the ability to communicate with members of their own clan through smell by exuding complex pheromones. This pheromonal language can not be understood by any other species, or even by Weequays of another clan. Only Jedi senses can even tell that two Weequay are communicating. Since each Weequay’s pheromones are unique, Weequay have no need for a name within their clan. As a result, speech is only a secondary form of communication for Weequay, and they seldom speak a whole sentence, resulting in Humans mistakenly believing the species to be unintelligent.\n\nMale Weequay often tie their hair into a long braid each year spent away from their homeworld as a tribute to their home. When they returned, they shaved their braids. Weequays serving the Hutts were often very close to their homeworld, and would only have one or two braids. Female Weequay were usually bald, and did not follow this tradition.\n\nNAMES\nOnly Weequay who have to live among other clans, or among non-Weequay, take a personal name. Even then, some are simply referred to as “Weequay”. In Weequay culture, individual identity is much less important than the clan. As long as the clan survives, a single Weequay is expendable.

The species has two sexes, female and male. The latter grows long beards in adult life. Wookiee eye colors are usually blue, green, yellow, golden, brown, or red.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nWookiees greatly value honor and loyalty. Therefore, their notion of “family” encompassed much more than just blood ties. A part of that most sacred tradition was the social institution of life debt: when a wookiee’s life was saved by someone else, regardless of the species, they would frequently devote themselves to a lifetime of service to their savior and their family. Through the mechanism of the life debt, the People of the Trees used to develop unbreakable bonds with their boon companions and true friends, forming a “honor family.”\n\nNAMES\nWookiee names are diverse; some names are simple and short while others are long and complicated.

The most striking of these are a series of vestigial horns that crown the heads of both males and females. These horns grow at puberty in varying patterns and signified that their rite of passage is drawing near.\n\nIn addition to their horns, another of the traits that make zabrak instantly recognizable are their facial tattoos, which are made up of thin lines received during their rite of passage. These could symbolize many things, including but not limited to family lineage, place of birth, or even a design that reflected their individual personalities.\n\nLastly, zabraks possess a second heart.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nZabrak are often seen by most other species as being single-minded, an observation that is not terribly incorrect. This single-minded determination comes from the fact that they are a species with a strong sense of self-assuredness, confident that they are able to accomplish any task that they set out to do. However, this does not lead a zabrak to develop a sense of prideful superiority towards others. Though it is not uncommon to see competition between colonies, this is not seen as a negative.

The fingers are paired in twos and slightly spaced apart from the others. The eyes of the anomids are solid, with no visible irises or pupils and have been seen in varying shades of yellow or blue. The anomids have pointed, fin-like ears that protrude from the sides of their heads. Anomid hair is often long and well kept, and is always found in shades of black, gray or white.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nAnomids almost always wear elaborate masks which cover most of their faces. These are not breath masks, but vocalizer units. Since anomids have no vocal cords, they rely on these vocalizer masks to communicate with other species. These masks are often elaborately customized to reflect an anomid’s social status, family origin, or profession. Among themselves, anomids communicate using an elaborate sign language. Anomid sign language requires six-fingered hands, which makes it difficult for humans or human-programmed protocol droids to use.\n\nAnomid civilization has a long history of pacifism and technical achievement.

These facial tusks are highly sensitive to heat and cold and are used for cracking open the hard shells of shellfish or burrowing through the swampy loam of their homeworld. Having finned hands and two bulbous black eyes, Aqualish are unable to manipulate most machinery or equipment developed by the galaxy’s many species which designed these tools for beings with digits. As a result, Aqualish tend to remain on their homeworld. Aqualish are well known for their hair-trigger tempers that flare without reason.\n\nWhile Force-sensitive Aqualish are rare, members of the species have trained as both Sith and Jedi, though they typically gravitate toward the former.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe Aqualish hate the image they have in the galaxy as thugs, regardless of its veracity, and blame it on any- and everyone else.

Cona is always hot, and has very little water, but the atmosphere is filled with ammonia vapor. Arcona adapted to this environment by eating the ammonia-converting roots of flora as a source of water. Arcona depended on the ammonia to live and, as a result, arcona living offworld have to take ammonia supplements. Despite their large eyes, arcona have very poor eyesight. Their eyes, made up of thousands of photoreceptors, can not detect fine shapes, only seeing blurry objects. To aid this, they have a small sensory organ between their eyes. Often mistaken for their nose, this organ detects heat patterns from living beings. Thus, arcona can recognize things by its heat pattern.\n\nArcona are highly susceptible to addiction to spice and common salt, which serves as a hallucinogen with effects resembling that of intoxication. Their eyes shift to gold after prolonged addiction.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nArcona normally think of themselves not as individuals but as a collective whole. Largely forsaking individuality, they often refer to themselves as “we” even when alone. The arcona live in loose, family-based communities called nests, which are ruled by a Grand Nest. Because arcona are born in nests underground, they obtain a close sense of family living in close quarters with siblings.

It is not unheard of for arkanians to undergo genetic or cybernetic manipulation of their own bodies, enhancing themselves so as to be better than “lesser” species.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nArkanians are notoriously arrogant, a trait which came from generations of producing some of the galaxy’s greatest advancements in genetics and technology. Their homeworld, Arkania, has vast quantities of precious gems; thus, the arkanians have never wanted for much in trade. This wealth went into funding their ambitious scientific projects, the most elaborate of which take generations to be completed.\n\nMany arkanians have come to see their species as the pinnacle of evolution, and amongst the most if not the most intelligent beings in the galaxy.

The most striking difference between balosars and humanity is a pair of antennapalps which sprouts from underneath the thick, coarse hair on their skulls. Retractable, these atennapalps allow them to listen into the subsonic range and give the species physical intuition and preternatural reflexes, which members of the Jedi Order sometimes mistook for Force-sensitivity. Balosars also possess an acute tolerance for poisonous substances, a byproduct of life on their toxic homeworld.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nEarly in its history, the balosar homeworld was overrun by galactic megacorporations eager to exploit the world’s lax ecological protection laws. The planet was home to the balo mushroom, a key ingredient in death sticks, one of the galaxy’s most infamous narcotics. After its discovery, Balosar was wrought with corruption, addiction, and pollution from the production and usage of death sticks.\n\nSince there is little opportunity to flourish on their homeworld, balosars often leave in search of fortune elsewhere. Their natural resistance to the lethal�but not the addictive�effects of the drug encourages some to enter the death stick business.\n\nNAMES\nBalosar names have a slight exotic tinge to them�often because Balosar parents name their children while on a death stick high.

A blaster set on stun would not damage them at all or slow them down, as it would merely bounce off their scales. Barabel are able to shed their tails if necessary, an ability that proved the undoing of many startled foes. They also possess heavy retractable claws along with needle sharp teeth which can grow to be 2 inches in length. A carnivorous species, Barabel possess two stomachs in order to process the massive amount of food they required to survive.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nLiving in low tech communities ranging from a few dozen individuals to no more than ten thousand, the Barabel community is built around a warren where the group thrives and hunted from. The Barabel species is noted for its hunting and tracking prowess; many of their actions are fueled by their hunting instincts, leading to the general feeling that Barabel are always angry. They are well known for their aggression but are also extremely loyal.

Noted for their thick, wrinkled skin which can resist most physical attacks and their shuffling gait, the large-headed race have no obvious differences between male and female baragwin. An acute sense of smell give the species enough sensitivity to detect another being’s mood and feelings. This leads some of them into careers as big-game hunters, or even as bounty hunters. Due to their ponderous movement, many non-baragwin believe the race to be a dull-witted people while, in fact, they are quite intelligent. Despite this fact, the baragwin frequently keep this intelligence hidden, using the misconceptions of others to their own advantage.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nBaragwin culture, since it does not derive from a single homeworld, is highly dependent on a baragwin’s planet of origin, with Tatooinian baragwin behaving quite differently from those from Denuhi-Eight. Baragwin generally have little prejudice, treating all other beings equally regardless of species, culture, or planetary origins; though criminal baragwin will exploit all beings equally instead. Baragwin settlements are generally small and anarchic, with short-term leaders selected by informal democratic processes.

Scruffy sensory whiskers lined the area below their noses, just above the robust wattle most adult Besalisks possessed.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nBecause of Ojom’s harsh environment, large cities were never developed on the world; instead small communes of about a thousand families claim territories around the world and are each led by an elected leader. The communes have a strict policy of keeping the size of their groupings equal to avoid conflict. When too many families grow in one area, the leader would ask certain families to break away and start a new community on another glacier.\n\nWhile not involved in galactic politics and because they do not produce any of their own technology, the Besalisks established large orbital space stations where offworlders could come to do business.

A memnis is as vivid to one who receives it as it was to the one who participated in the event remembered. Their peace-loving natures are in part due to memnii, as having a memory of killing or harming will be particularly strong, becoming unbearable in time, and something caamasi will seek to avoid except in defense of themselves or others, for which case they would accept their burden.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nA pacifist race, culture on Caamas evolved around the basic tenets of peace and social justice; influencing the evolution of the Jedi Order.

However following the devastation of their homeworld by the Empire, caamasi who were off-world at the time considered evolving to a position of polygamy so as to regrow the population. While the argument is one of survival, many sociologists familiar with the culture of the caamasi believe that they will not accept the idea.\n\nNAMES\nCaamasi surnames are often composed of two parts, with the second part designating clan membership.\n\nMale Names.

The two different sexes of Chadra-Fan are indistinguishable to other species, though the Chadra-Fan could readily tell the difference using their powerful sense of smell. Chadra-Fan also have involuntary pheromones that conveyed information about their family line and created an aura of attractiveness. Other voluntary pheromones often conveyed a Chadra-Fan’s state of emotion-anger, fear, or joy. Chadra-Fan even create more complex messages using their pheromones, though the pheromones when mixed sometimes caused confusion. They are unique in the fact that they had clear blood.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe society of Chadra-Fan is divided into a clan structure in which every member is responsible for parenting the clan’s children; a fact of life is that every household is open at any time. Leadership within the clan is a temporary role that is passed from one individual to another as the situation calls for a particular expertise. Children are the centerpiece of a Chadra-Fan community, and only leave when wed. However the new Chadra-Fan couple remain with the smaller clan so it was possible that a Chadra-Fan never leaves his or her home.\n\nChadra-Fan left by themselves suffer depression, so they regularly seek the company of others; thus, Chadra-Fan are not very picky when it came to friends and prefer complete strangers to loneliness\n\nNAMES\nChadra-Fan names do not vary significantly based on sex.

During this time, their arms, legs, and air-breathing lungs develop. Adult Chagrians are truly amphibious, retaining their ability to breathe underwater while also able to function without difficulty in air. They also possess acute low-light vision.\n\nThe average Chagrian stands taller than a Human. They are distinguished by two fleshy growths protruding from the sides of their heads, which they call lethorns. As they age, the lethorns thicken. Males also sport two horns growing from the top of their skulls. These were once used in underwater duels to attract a mate, and are seen as a sign of the males’ strength and virility. Females lack the superior cranial horns, but had more pronounced and longer posterior head plates; these can reach halfway down their back. Chagrians also have very long black forked tongues.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nAs a species, Chagrians are generally peaceful and law-abiding to the point of becoming stoic and obstinate. Many Chagrians are motivated only by basic desires such as sustenance, shelter, and healthcare. Chagrian government ensures that every citizen is cared and provided for, so the standard of living for the poorest Chagrian is high compared to the members of other species. Chagrians who expect violence often wear red.\n\nNAMES\nChagrian names have a very melodic tone. Male names are typically shorter than female names. Surnames are familial.\n\nMale Names.

Even after they gained access to galactic technology, they continued to live as nomads (though more affluent Chevin mounted their lodges on large repulsorlift vehicles instead.) Their Chev slaves are usually forced to follow on foot. Nomadic groups of Chevin keep in touch via comlinks, and often converge on a single location to deal with danger.\n\nThe only Chevin settlements that stay in place for more than one standard month are the Government Villages, where Chevin dictators live with their hand-picked advisors.

A chironian can sit down by folding his or her horse-like legs underneath the body. Chironians can also kick backward with both hind legs; this strong kick is sufficient to knock over other beings. A chironian’s pace can vary between a walk, a canter, and a gallop.\n\nEach year, chironian heads grows two horns above the temples. These horns start as small knobs covered by red-furred velvet: a vascular tissue. Once the knobs have grown sufficiently, they break through the velvet naturally, emerging as transparent horns, as bright as diamond, cool to the touch and with smooth ridges. However, if the velvet is cut artificially, chironians can die from the injury. Over time, the horns grow long and sharp enough that adolescent chironians can use them to gore opponents.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nChironians express emotions through the mannerisms of their hooves: when impatient, they stamp them; when excited, they tap them in a quick dance, or canter in a spot. The centauriforms frequently shake their heads and manes, and when angry, their faces flush a deeper shade. Young chironians, when frightened, are known to rub or press their velvet-covered horns against the foreheads of other beings to whom they are emotionally close.\n\nNAMES\nChironian names are soft and melodic, despite the thick nature of their native language.

Their insectoid minds provide them a natural defense against mind tricks.\n\nSome members are colicoid queens that are different as they are more than twice the size of even the largest warrior breeds. This makes them extremely dangerous and are the only colicoids that possess a unique poisonous stinger. This combined with their strength and size makes them deadly combatants, especially when within their nests. However, a queen tends to only fight when her young are being threatened.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThough highly intelligent, colicoids are emotionless and cannibalistic in nature. Their ruthless cunning serves them well on the battlefield as it does on the negotiating table. It is known that long ago that they transferred these ruthless characteristics to their commerce activities. As a result, they are known to be brutally efficient in their business practices. They are noted for being vicious and calculating creatures that are driven by greed whilst showing little regard for others. The colicoids have numerous successful commercial ventures and hold strict business protocols.\n\nNAMES\nColicoid names are typically very short and gender neutral, with surnames being based on the queen from which they spawned.\n\nFirst Names. Gal, Het, Kaf, Lyp, Nok, Yin\n\nSurnames. Bek, Dor, Set, Tel, Wim, Zal" compset="Race">

The ability is limited to communication; a Draethos can not invade the thoughts of others.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nPartly due to their long lives, Draethos society was slow to evolve and relies heavily on tradition. The Draethos’ culture is warrior-based, and those living on the homeworld are expected to demonstrate their martial or hunting prowess. Life on Draethos is harsh, with arrogant aristocrats squabbling among one another for social standing and wealth. Warriors are perpetually in high demand as gladiators, mercenaries, hunters, and soldiers. Those who make a conscious decision to abandon the way of the warrior are exiled to seek a new life among aliens.

Their primary means of locomotion is their strong arms, and their lower limbs and feet were used for grappling and other fine motor manipulation. They hardly ever walk on their lower limbs. Although most Dugs may walk on all four limbs, others like to use their strong arms as legs and their feet as hands like they would normally do.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nDue to their oppression under their Gran rulers who colonized Malastare, many Dugs often feel the need to throw around their strength in bids to establish dominance. As a result, they are known for their ill-tempered demeanor, and many are bullying thugs.\n\nOn their homeworld of Malastare, the vast majority of Dugs are little more than laborers toiling for the enrichment of the Gran. With the species excluded from much of the power and money on Malastare, many Dugs turn to swoop racing or bounty hunting as their only means to achieve fame and fortune. In all other areas, the Dugs are exploited.\n\nNAMES\nDug names are often 3 syllables long, mostly through big sounds rather than harsh tones. There are harsher tones in their names as well though, often in the forms of x’s and k’s. Female Dugs have softer names, but no one would call them beautiful.

This is no biologicial trait inherent to the species, but rather stems from the fact that combat is so ingrained into every level of echani culture; the echani hold to the idea that combat is the truest form of communication, and to know someone fully, you must fight them.

  <thing id="rPREshKa" name="Esh-Ka" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nEsh-kha are a gray-skinned humanoid species with equine features, including muzzles and digitigrade legs. They also have small black eyes.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nIn terms of society, their race’s culture resembles that of a hive society though each individual retain their own thoughts and aspirations yet all being bred for a specific role that they were eager to fulfill. A caste system is present amongst the esh-kha which included Force-sensitive simple minded savants, more numerous skilled determined warriors that watched over them and finally the patriarchs that acted as leaders who provided their wisdom as well as decisions to their entire people. Esh-kha appear to outsiders as a savage violent species that care only for the destruction of all other races. This hatred for other sentient species is believed to had stemmed from their tightly-knit hive-like society. It is suspected that the esh-kha are simply unable to tolerate or even adapt to the existence of thinking of outsiders who only suffered their wrath. Their race only turns violent against one another in the most extreme of circumstances.\n\nNAMES\nWhilst their kind are individuals, esh-kha are not named at birth but instead earn their names through their actions. An esh-kha that displayed great skill in battle could be called “Swift Blade”, or maybe “Deadly Cutter” or some other such name. It is believed that this partly explained an esh-kha’s zeal in battle with young warriors seeking not only victory but an opportunity to lay claim to a name and forge their own identity. Esh-kha do not use surnames, as they believe they are one family.\n\nNames. Bleeding Yell, Dormant Heart, Blue Survivor, Ancient Cull, Sharp Grip, Running Sun, Flame Walker" compset="Race">

In addition to their strikingly beautiful appearance, the Falleen exude pheromones which makes them all but irresistible to both sexes.\n\nThe Falleen are semi-aquatic, being able to hold their breath underwater for an extended period of time. Fallen are one of few species that are resistant to manipulation by the Force.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nFalleen society is of a feudal nature, with noble houses ruling over the lower classes. The upper echelons of Falleen aristocracy are rife with politics and intrigue, though they rarely spill blood over disputes or reduce themselves to open warfare.\n\nAs a cold-blooded species, the Falleen respect discipline and control, particularly self-control. They tend to shun public displays of emotion, and are very patient. As a result of this attitude, they tend to look down on the more openly passionate, whom they see as lacking self-control.

A Felucian’s head is a thick mass of long flexible tendrils featuring illuminated tips. The eyes and mouth appear as black holes or openings within this mass.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nFelucians are mysterious sentient beings native to the vast fungal swamps and jungles of Felucia. Though Felucia has long been colonized, the native Felucians avoided notice by living deep in the jungle. Such seclusion was easily maintained. Even the hardiest of colonists were loath to brave the perils of the dangerous wilderness without cause.\n\nThe Felucians are an unusual, amphibious species. They are highly adapted to surviving the wilds of their home planet, and fade easily into its confusing mass of plant life. They are equally at home on land or in the water, and they traverse the swamps with ease.\n\nAll Felucians are part of a single, planetwide tribe that is broken down into smaller villages and communities, each one led by shamans and chieftains.

Their body structure also more closely matches that of a trandoshan or dashade, being bulky and imposing in stature, towering over most other sentient creatures.\n\nUnlike contemporary rakata, flesh raiders did not lose their ability to tap into the Force.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nFlesh raiders are known to form small clan structures, with a war boss in charge of the clan. Those flesh raiders who are born Force-sensitive can be found imitating a temple structure, with a powerful Force-sensitive, usually from another species, leading them.\n\nFlesh raiders still speak the rakatan language, though it has developed into a cruder variant.\n\nNAMES\nFlesh raider names tend to be short and concise, embodying strength and virility.

The exoskeleton provides extra protection in the clavicle region, which prevented most nerve or pressure-point strikes to the neck and shoulders. In addition, Gands have the remarkable ability to regrow lost limbs. If a Gand is dismembered, it can regrow a lost limb in a few days.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nGand society places heavy importance on the achievements of an individual and holds that an individual has no name, and thus no worth, until he or she proves otherwise. The speech patterns of Gands utilize third-person self-reference within each level of identity earned. Young or unproven Gands are all called “Gand,” as they are considered merely aspects of the same whole. Major accomplishments earn the use of a family surname. Mastering a skill, such as becoming a findsman, allows for the use of the given name, all with third-person self-reference. This manner of speaking is common within the spoken and written Gand language but is more predominant when a Gand speaks Basic; it is often a source of amusement to outsiders.\n\nNAMES\nUntil a Gand has earned the use of a name, they go simply by the term “Gand.” Gand speak in the third person and refer to themselves by name. Often, when a Gand feels shamed, they will stop referring to themselves by their name and revert to calling themselves “Gand” until they prove themselves again.

Workers are conditioned to loathe even the concept of separation from their hive and the system of control. A low-ranking worker’s normal life is one of endless toil and labor to satisfy the aristocracy, who are known to make spectacular demands.

Because of the harsh environment of their homeworld, the Givins’ organs are sealed against atmospheric exposure; thanks to this complex system, they can survive for about a day in a vacuum.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nIn order to survive their homeworld’s lunar tides, the Givin became extremely adept at calculating the trajectory of their celestial bodies. Over the ages, Givin have become so skilled at celestial navigation that they are able to calculate hyperspace jumps in their heads. As such, mathematics have become a cornerstone of Givin society. Two Givin will often greet each other by exchanging complex equations for the other to solve.\n\nDue to their profound mathematical ability, Givin are skilled starship builders and astrogators. They create some of the most impressive, complex, and sleek ships in the galaxy. However, they frequently build their ships without the presence of a navcomputer or pressurization system, and so their buyers have to add these system in the starship aftermarket.\n\nNAMES\nGivin names are often derived by parents from favored mathematical equations.

  <thing id="rPRGotal" name="Gotal" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nGotals possess cranial horns as receptors to sense electromagnetism and other energy emissions. These nerve-ending filled cones can sense the natural electromagnetic fields produced by Antar 4’s magnetite-rich crust, allowing the species to operate even in total darkness. Their senses also pick up the electromagnetic auras from other life forms. When close to their hunting targets, they can ascertain information on its mood, awareness, and state of mind. Electronic devices can also be sensed by Gotals; in fact, most droids give off enough electromagnetic emissions to at least annoy a Gotal, and at worst to seriously disorient the horned beings, making them notoriously distrustful of droids. Gotals rely heavily on their cones, with their eyesight and hearing being quite weak, and their sense of smell almost completely absent.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nSince their natural empathy makes them instantly sensitive to the feelings of others, Gotals have little use for government or laws on their homeworld, resulting in problems when dealing with other societies. No central authority figure can speak for Antar 4 as a whole in a crisis, and no organized Gotal military or police force can act on their behalf. Other species respect the Gotals for their discretion and restraint, but some individuals fear interacting with the horned beings for fear of having their emotional state revealed to others.\n\nNAMES\nGotal names are quite guttural, though there are also many harsher tones within their names. Gotal names do not vary significantly based on gender, and surnames are familial.\n\nFirst Names. Thon, Fern, Fuu’rash, Jir, Vluphol\n\nSurnames.

They have excellent vision, able to resolve more colors than most species, and even able to see into the infrared, thus they are able to sense one another’s emotions and disposition by noting subtle changes in body heat and skin color. Gran have two stomachs, having evolved from herbivorous grazing animals who lived in herds on the mountains and highlands of Kinyen. A single meal can take almost an entire day to finish, after that a Gran does not often need to eat for several days.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe peaceful nature of Gran society is a reflection of their homeworld, Kinyen. Kinyen boasted large and rolling grasslands and highlands, a dense and beautiful forest, and one of the longest and clearest rivers in the Bes Ber Bikade sector. The beauty of this planet, and the need for primitive Gran to band together for defense against predatory animals, helped the Gran develop strong bonds of home and family in their society.\n\nThe Grans are also very protective of their families, and were some of the most devoted parents in the galaxy. This is because of their very powerful and sensitive sight, which can sense the emotions of their mates and their children. Gran society maintains its balance by setting up strict career quotas, and making sure young Gran are educated for a specific job that best served his or her talents.\n\nNAMES\nGran names typically are monosyllabic and accompanied by a surname, which is familial.\n\nMale Names.

Their girth tends to leave them feeling out of place among smaller species; herglic tend to take up two chairs or fill the entire doorway of any establishment they enter that does not cater to beings their size.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe herglics are very technologically advanced, developing space flight and hyperdrives and colonizing their sector of the galaxy prior to the formation of the Galactic Republic.

Their “snake hair” is temperature-sensitive, allowing ho’din to sense changes in ambient temperature.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nHo’dins are known to be self-conscious and vain, particularly when it comes to their looks and their work, and do not take criticism or insults well. Their religion, Dinante Fli’R, is centered around worshipping and communing with nature, a trait that has sent many ho’din out into the galaxy to rejuvenate damaged planets.

Despite their legendary size, hutts start out as tiny huttlets less than half a foot in height, and continually grow over the long lives.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nMost hutts are crime lords who live opulent lives overseeing criminal underworld activities like spice smuggling, slavery, gambling and bounty hunting. This is not true for all, however, as some eschew the life of a decadent, obese version of their species and prefer a more mobile existence. Hutt society is divided into families known as kajidics, a social structure that is both familial and a crime gang.\n\nHutts are encouraged to make a name for themselves around the age of 150 while simultaneously not threatening the welfare of the clan. At around 200, they will likely stop being saved by the clan and encouraged even further to fend for themselves while benefiting the kajidic; they may even be granted a star system or two. Nomadic or kajidic-less hutts are often hunted or killed by other hutts in fear of the nomad coming to claim a territory.\n\nNAMES\nHutt names with a suffix title as “the Hutt” are usually reserved for noteworthy huts, with the name of a hutt’s kajidic coming before the title. Because hutts are hermaphroditic, choosing a gender at will, their names are considered androgynous.\n\nFirst Names. Arok, Gorga, Jabba, Mama, Ziro,\n\nKajidic Names.

The horns are able to regenerate if damaged.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe Iktotchi are a fiercely guarded and isolationist species - vaunted for their ability to hide their feelings and bury any semblance of emotion. Originating on the harsh, windy moon of Iktotch, which orbits the planet Iktotchon in the Expansion Region, the Iktotch are gifted with precognition, and are courted as often by Jedi as by pirates for their skills.\n\nIktotchi society is a stratified society.

Most of their facial features are obscured behind the traditional masks they wear, and outsiders rarely see Kaleesh unmasked. They are known to practice polygyny, a form of polygamy, where a male courts multiple wives.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nKaleesh society is divided into numerous autonomous tribes. War is viewed as an essential and sacred practice, and the culture’s large emphasis on honor is known to spur many acts of vengeance among the various tribes. However, when necessary, the tribes will put aside their differences and bond to fend off a common enemy.\n\nThe Kaleesh are a spiritual people, believing that those who perform great deeds in life became gods in death; therefore, burial places are sacred to them.

Kallerans are tall and flexible; their hands and feet have three prehensile digits on each, which leeds kallerans to avoid wearing shoes or boots. The majority of kallerans have green skin patterned with distinctive black stripes. The species have dense muscles that assist them in the protection of their otherwise delicate bodies. The kalleran head is distinguished by fin-like folds on the tops and sides of their faces. These fins augment a kalleran’s hearing, allowing sound to bounce back and be picked up by the two antenna crowning their head. These antenna are sensory organs that serve as olfactory and aural receptors. Kallerans have lungs adapted to breathe above water, though the majority of their respiration is done through their skin. A holdover from their amphibious past, their skin can draw oxygen in from the air and filter out carbon dioxide. Their respiratory system requires them to consume more water than other species their size to keep their skin moist and supple. Because they do not primarily breathe through their mouths, kallerans did not evolve noses.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nAbove all else, kalleran’s value personal achievement over collective accomplishments. Because of this, the people of Kaller have never united to form great societies or participate in galactic affairs.

The almond-shaped eyes of kaminoans are also able to see color in the ultraviolet spectrum. While female kaminoans are bald, males possess headcrests and fin ridges along the rear of their small, bulbous skulls.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe kaminoans see themselves as a superior form of life, but nevertheless remained polite to outsiders. To them any species seeking self-improvement is worthy of respect, but those who do not are obviously inferior; self-improvement has a central role in Kaminoan society. Through the development and mastery of selective breeding, genetics, and cloning, the kaminoans were able to overcome a cataclysm that pushed them to the brink of extinction.\n\nKaminoans live in a caste based society, determined by the color of the kaminoan’s eyes. Gray eyed individuals handle administration and are considered of the highest-level caste; middle castes had yellow eyes and handle the skilled work; and lower castes had blue eyes and perform manual labor and other menial tasks.

They are also notable for their heavy brows and ridges along the tops of their heads.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nFor centuries, klatooinians have been slaves to the hutts, whom they view as almost godlike, immortal beings. Although the hutts allow a council of elders to rule on Klatooine, all off-world affairs are wholly under hutt control. Under the hutts, the klatooinians serve as soldiers and guards. Even those klatooinians who do not serve the hutts are often employed as hired muscle by other masters.\n\nKlatooinian society was known for a strong belief in tradition and the wisdom of the elders, although some younger klatooinians rebelled against this norm and sought out freedom from enslavement. Others attempted to gain their own fortunes as smugglers, pirates, bounty hunters, or raiders.\n\nNAMES\nKlatooinian names are often derived from the names of great heroes and historical figures.

They have adapted to their sun-scorched, vegetation-deprived world by learning to survive off their world’s native insect population. Filled with two rows of teeth for gnashing their food, the Kubaz trunk also functions as a highly sensitive nose. Due to living on their homeworld of Kubindi�a planet which orbits a blue star�Kubaz are highly sensitive to red wavelengths; when traveling to planets with a red or yellow star, Kubaz are forced to don protective eyewear to avoid damaging their sensitive eyes.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe Kubazi society is based on a clan structure which dwell in underground nests. Ruled by a queen, each clan takes the name of their queen they are descended from. Developing a non-verbal language of hand gestures which indicated their intentions, Kubaz are able to speak Galactic Basic, though with a strong nasally accent. When interacting with other species, some Kubaz will share certain hand signals with non-Kubaz in order to ease communications. Obsessed with tact and decorum, the Kubaz place a high emphasis on the family unit and proper courtesies, displaying truthfulness to a fault. Valuing art and literature with such vigor as to sometimes practice smuggling of great works, the Kubaz do not find such pursuits to be wrong or unlawful. Due to their diet on Kubindi, the Kubaz have poor relations with sentient insectile species.\n\nNAMES\nKubaz names are usually dominated by harsher sounds, but some names lean more melodic.

A Lannik’s skin tends to be of colours similar to his or her eyes and hair. The species has evolved long pointy ears which allow them to hear better than human ears.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe Lannik culture is apparently war loving, and Lanniks feel a great respect for warriors. At the same time, though, they follow a strict centuries-old code of honour. Lannik soldiers have the custom of tying all their hair in a single topknot over their head. Their species is one of fierce warriors, whose abilities have developed fighting against terrible predators and other Lanniks in a long history of wars. Although many regard the Lannik as hotheaded and temperamental, they are quite fearless and clear-headed even in combat, giving them the ability to think their way out of a dangerous situation.\n\nThe Lannik do not show their thoughts through their facial expressions, and seem always angry to other species.

Many lurmen have the ability to roll themselves into a wheeled shape; this allows them to cover distances at great speed. They may have learned this ability from the native amani on Maridun.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe lurmen use fallen seedpods from the giant trees as shelter and home. Living near the trees proves too dangerous, as the falling pods can be deadly. Instead, the lurmen drag the pods into a clearing and use them as huts. They also extract essential oils from the pods for nutrition and healing medicines. Most lurmen are pacifistic by nature and refuse to fight or run even in the face of death. They often will hide instead of using violence. As pacifists, they carry no weapons but carry farming tools or ropes. The greatest native threat to the lurmen are the amani and the mastiff phalones, raptor-headed quadrupeds that hunted in groups. However, even in defeating these beasts the lurmen attempt to remain true to their pacifist ideals, and not inflict any injury to the creatures. Instead, when cornered by a mastiff phalone, an agile lurmen will try to unbalance the creature by tying a rope around its stout legs.\n\nNAMES\nLurmen names are sharp and made up of a single syllable.

The mikkians’ most distinctive feature are their motile head-tendrils, with the number, form, and pattern varying between individuals. These head-tendrils primarily serve as sensory organs, particularly detecting sound as a replacement for an ear common in other species. Mikkian head-tendrils also could detect other information, such as humidity, temperature, magnetic direction and radiation. This radiation detection can be detected to the extent that mikkians can “see” light and dark, although their eyes are still their primary visual organs.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nMikkians place kinship and integrity above all. In fact, their honesty can come across as blunt or even rude to other sentients. Conversely, mikkians often have trouble adjusting to the more flexible views of other races. Their complex code of honor encompass all things in life, with a particular insistance on matters of warfare. Although they respect warrior traditions, the Mikkians nevertheless value discipline and honor over victory or physical might.\n\nDifferent religious traditions exist among the Mikkians, but belief in the Force plays a central role in all of them. In Mikkian society, their head-tendrils have important cultural significance, and as such tendril-reading is used by Mikkian mystics to predict their future.

This vision is so strong that if a Miraluka looks upon a Jedi or Sith, they can “see” Force radiating off them. The strength of a Miraluka’s connection to the Force varies by individual.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nMiraluka are a thoughtful, cautious, and deliberative species. They have little interest in personal gain or glory. For social reasons, Miraluka hide their appearance by wearing a headband, a mask, or similar concealing headwear. In addition all Miraluka are very united by species. They call themselves “brothers” and are considered as members of a great family. As a Force-using species, Miraluka are often quite shocked if ‘shown’ life not connected to the Force.\n\nMany Miraluka worship two gods, Ashla and Bogan, through the philosophy of the Greater Force. They do not believe in good or evil, but were taught to accept both life and death.\n\nMiraluka Force-sensitives are an order of their own called the Luka Sene. Academic in atmosphere and culture, the Luka Sene focus primarily on developing the sense-related powers of their members. However, unlike the Jedi, Sith and other traditions, the Luka Sene does not dictate a member’s personal life.\n\nNAMES\nMiraluka names are generally two syllables. Miraluka don’t use surnames, as they believe they are one family.\n\nMale Names. Aakih, Pafil, Rikhor, Vociif, Xuwuth\n\nFemale Names. Auchaod, Favom, Mucem, Wilierth" compset="Race">

They have green to yellow skin and tattoos on their faces. The Mirialans are known for their spirituality and strong connection with the world around them. Mirialans are very flexible and agile, making them fast and formidable foes.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe Mirialan people are deeply religious and practice a primitive understanding of the Force. They believe each individual’s actions contribute to their destiny, building upon past successes and failures to drive them towards their fates. Within their belief system was the view that individual actions ripple through the Force, also affecting the destiny of the species as a whole.\n\nA Mirialan often places a unique, geometrically repeated tattoo on their face and hands to signify that they have completed a certain test or task, or achieved sufficient aptitude for a certain skill. The number of tattoos often acts as a good indicator of how mature and/or skilled a Mirialan was. Because the more markings brings about a form of status, Mirialan society is stratified and allows the heavily marked citizens to access greater opportunities. Despite its importance, most Mirialans do not know the entirety of the tattoo lexicon due to its complexity. The interaction between placement and positioning of the shapes is incredibly subtle and changes their meaning greatly." compset="Race">

They are divided into two subspecies: the lanky northern mustafarians, and the stocky southern mustafarians. The southern mustafarians were notable for their greater strength, making them more suited to manual labor. Both subspecies shared many traits, particularly their hardened exoskeletons and leathery skin, which acclimated them to the extreme heat of their volcanic environment.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nMustafarians evolved from arthropods living in the slightly cooler hollows within dormant volcanoes on the surface of Mustafar. As a result of such close living, mustafarian culture is isolationist by nature, though they tolerate trade with other systems. Mustafar hosts scarce minerals and rare metals, making mustafarians an invaluable trade partner.\n\nNative mustafarians rarely take sides when galactic conflicts rage, instead preferring to keep to themselves and control their own planet.

Their eyes also have pupils that split horizontally, and they are distinguished by small lumps on their foreheads and down-turned mouths. Instead of noses, they have olfactory glands underneath their eyes. These genetic differences are attributed to the distinct features of their homeworld, Neimoidia, including its gravity, which is markedly heavier than duro.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nNeimoidians spend their formative years as puny grubs in the communal hives of Neimoidia, until the age of seven standard years. They are knowingly neglected by being given limited amounts of food. This way, the weaker individuals are weeded out, while the most acquisitive grubs hoard more food than they can eat by themselves. Neimoidian education ensures the survival of the greediest. Neimoidians place tremendous value on wealth and material possessions, and would go to great lengths to gain money and power. This has resulted in a stereotype of neimoidians being greedy and cowardly.

Their eyes are covered by a protective membrane, being a thin transparent pellicle that protects their eyes underwater and during windstorms. As a result, they are noted for their “staring” eyes and a seemingly blank expression which leads to many underestimating nikto intelligence.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nAlthough lacking in personal charisma, nikto posses a single-minded tenacity that makes them excellent followers. Their lives made nikto cunning combatants. Most nikto are content with a life of servitude as in their eyes a life in slavery was preferable to the hardship and toil on their homeworld. Not all nikto work for the hutts though most free members of their kind were formerly enslaved. Whilst nikto are known to escape from their master, most tend to fall into service of another hutt who “inherited” them according to custom should their previous employer die. However, some escaped nikto did instead use some opportunities to genuinely become free beings. Any such emancipated nikto have to be constantly on guard as they risked capture by hutt-employed slavers who return their prey to their “rightful owners”. In addition, they lacked charisma and preferred to follow orders instead of giving them. As a result, the Nikto were most identified with their Hutt masters.\n\nNAMES\nNikto names are very complex, hard to pronounce, and harsh sounding.

  <thing id="rPRNoghri" name="Noghri" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nNoghri are a primitive humanoid species hailed from the planet Honoghr with steely gray-blue skin that are renowned assassins. A natural gift for stealth and hand-to-hand combat, Noghri are efficient killing machines with their rending claws and strong olfactory sense that can often determine familial lineage. Their smaller size belies their ruthlessness and potent hunting skills.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nNoghri culture relies heavily on honor, with society being clan-based, revolving around the Dukha, a community center in each village. The greatest strength of the Noghri stems from their loyalty and secrecy; when a Noghri takes a job, they always fulfill it, even if it would result in their death. As such, they make exceptional, albeit expensive bodyguards.\n\nNoghri are loathe to fight with weapons larger than small daggers, believing combat to be a personal celebration to be sullied by use of heavier weapons. As such, it is rare (though not impossible) to see a Noghri wielding a weapon larger than their forearm.\n\nEach Noghri clan village centers around the Dukha, with each clan being led by a Dynast. The Dukha is inhabited by the clan’s Maitrakh, who functions as the storyteller, spiritual leader, and lore keep of the clan.\n\nNAMES\nNoghri names vary from short to long, with female names being typically softer. Surnames are clan-based.\n\nMale Names. Cakhmaim, Ezrakh, Khabarakh, Rukh\n\nFemale Names. Cilnaas, Edvir, Kahr’corvh, Meewalh\n\nSurnames. Bakh’tor, Eikh’mir, Hakh’khar, Khim’bar" compset="Race">

Nothoiins’ appearance has earned their species the nickname of “Goldskins.”\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nAlthough nothoiins hail from their eponymous homeworld and star system in the Anoat Sector, they are ubiquitous throughout the Greater Javin Region and Corporate Sectors. Their history of interstellar exploration and colonization was facilitated by their species’ natural spacefaring abilities in both piloting and navigation and necessitated by their home planet’s periodically harsh, dry climate. Droughts on Nothoiin can last for decades, and the wildfires they foster have served as one of the primary factors behind the limited development of the planet’s economy beyond the ur-diamond mining industry, which produces the system’s chief export.\n\nLarge-scale emigration from Nothoiin has led members of its native species to seek careers as pilots, navigators, and operatives in numerous criminal enterprises. Various nothoiin colonies have given rise to a number of different governmental systems running the gamut from representative democracies to autocracies.\n\nNAMES\nNothoiin typically receive a gendered given name and a familial surname.\n\nMale Names.

They possess floppy ears, which are extremely sensitive to sound waves. They have two hands, each ending in four chubby fingers and a thumb, which is not opposable. A thick, baggy hide covered in fuzz resembling velvet hangs off of the Ortolan body. Ortolans have a keen sense of smell to help them forage for food. In fact, they are handicapped in their business affairs by their attachment to food, sometimes accepting otherwise unfavorable contracts when promised enough to eat. Their twin obsessions are food and music; offworld, many Ortolans find success as chefs or musicians.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nOrtolan society is reasonably industrialised, though not as technologically advanced as other species. Despite this, their economy is mostly based on barter, with credits primarily used to trade with offworlders. Education is the responsibility of their parents, though gifted youngsters are often traded to other families to get specialized education.\n\nWhile most Ortolans appear to have blue skin, Ortolans are actually covered in short velvety fur which they often dyed in bright colors, most often blue and pink. This tradition began when a Devaronian trader tried to sell Ortolans a shipment of food dyes�they considered dyeing their food a waste of time, but found dyed fur to be quite stylish.\n\nNAMES\nOrtolan names are generally short with big sounds.

They have compact but rotund midsections that top a pair of long, spindly legs ending in anisodactylic feet�three toes pointing forward, one back. This configuration, combined with their powerful lungs, enabled them to swim.\n\nThe most prominent feature of pa’lowick physiology is their prehensile snout, which ends in a pair of pouty, human-like lips. Pa’lowick are also born with sharp tusks, which some lose by middle age.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nPa’lowick live in large, independent communities with a feudal system of government. Many pa’lowick become fishers or hunters, as their biology allows.\n\nSongs and stories are the most treasured aspect of pa’lowick culture. Pa’lowick music runs the gamut of genres and subjects, although religious music is particularly common. Cultural heritage, such as history, genealogy, and parables, is largely passed down orally. Every Pa’lowick community has a dedicated storyteller; the esteem afforded this individual makes the position a coveted one.

With the advent of multiple wars fought in the system, different armies continue to see the aquatic world as a strategic bulwark in the region. Because of this, patrolians have to find work not only off-world, but typically in fields not falling under governmental purview; unfortunately, criminal activities are the most common path.\n\nNAMES\nPatrolian names are usually multisyllabic and sing-songy with lots of open vowels and few fricatives.

The species has pale, wrinkled skin, due to the fact that they lived in the sinkholes of Utapau, giving them limited access to light. These traits cause some to view them as frightening. However, Pau’ans as a society are generally friendly, and are happy to welcome guests to their often overlooked world. Pau’ans have long lifespans, living up to 700 years, much longer than the Utai. This earned them the nickname of “Ancients”.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nPau’ans fulfill most of the governmental and administrative duties on Utapau, as the utai do not desire such work, serving as laborers instead. Most pau’ans served as leaders early in their lives, often managing teams of Utai laborers. This gives them experience that will be used later in their lives. Pau’ans are kind leaders, and sympathetic to their subordinates. Each city on Utapau is controlled by a Master of Port Administration, a hereditary title reserved for pau’ans. These administrators are assisted by advisory councils for making important decisions about their city, and each administrator serves on the Utapauan Committee and oversees planetary governance.

In the two long protrusions that extended from either side of their faces, Quarren have gill-like structures that are actually hearing organs. The Quarren are also capable of spitting out clouds of ink as a defensive measure.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nQuarren are a very self-centered and proud species, almost to the point of being xenophobic, would coincides with their isolationist behavior. Quarren find Humans to be very crude beings and think Galactic Basic to be very cumbersome and unsuitable for speech. The Quarren instead speak their native language more frequently.\n\nThe Quarren are conservative and practical in their thinking, yet they reminisce more than they look to the future.

These bipedal beings have three digit hands that are tipped with claws for digging through packed dirt. As a species, they are uniformly lean and tall; while most rakata have a similar height and weight, females tend to be more slender than males, though just as tall. Rakata are primarily carnivorous, likely stemming from the fact that they are cannibalistic, often making a meal of other species.\n\nLong term abuse of the Force in their society, exacerbated by a plague, culled the rakata’s ability to sense the Force.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nRakatan technology and structures hold the unique property of blending with the Force, creating powerful and long-lasting monuments that are almost impossibly to replicate. Rakatan society is devoted to conquering and enslaving those they deem weak. At the height of its power, the Rakatan Infinite Empire had conquered and enslaved dozens of worlds. They would strip entire planets of their resources and then terraform them to fit their own needs.\n\nAfter a plague ravaged their civilization and caused the fall of the Infinite Empire, rakata broke off into smaller tribes rather than a unified organization. Despite their newfound tribal nature, rakata retained their ability to quickly adapt to and appropriate technology.\n\nNAMES\nRakatan names do not distinguish by gender, and they do not use surnames.\n\nNames.

The remarkably harsh conditions on the planet nearly drove its population to extinction. For eons, the Rattataki constantly battled amongst themselves and their fellow inhabitants (represented primarily by Humans, Zabraks, Siniteens, Vollick, and Weequay) over the planet’s limited resources. Despite being nearly completely isolated from the outside galaxy, the Rattataki displayed remarkable initiative and continually created new ways to kill each other.\n\nRattataki culture is bloody and unforgiving.

The species’ two arms consist of feathered wings ending in nimble humanoid hands, capable of manipulating tools. The wings grant the Rishii the ability to fly at great speeds, which is their method of travel equivalent to running in land-based species. A Rishii’s head contained a beak between two yellow eyes framed by a large brow. Rishii were capable of mimicking anything said to them perfectly, and also possessed extremely strong senses, particularly hearing and sight.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nNative to the planet Rishi, the Rishii live in loose primitive tribes, known as nests, clustered high upon the planet’s mountains, away from the hot and humid lowland swamps. Each nest consists of a small number of family units led by a chieftain, with neighbouring nests respecting each others territories and living in harmony. This peaceful and accepting attitude goes beyond just other Rishii and was extended to all neighbours of a nest, including the many other species who colonise the lowlands of Rishi. Due to the unfavorable conditions found in the lowlands, the native avians do not understand the off-worlders’ choice to live there, but were not opposed to their presence.\n\nNAMES\nAs with much of their speech, Rishii names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. Typically, a name has two to four syllables with the sounds acting as connectors. Rishii names do not vary based on gender. Rishii are responsive to nicknames given by outsiders." compset="Race">

Very uniquely ryn in nature, are their beak-like noses that contain fluted holes. These holes allow the ryn to play their ‘beaks’ like flutes. This talent has been used to communicate between ryn and has uniquely been observed in communication with droids.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nWanderlust consumes the ryn. The ryn are a nomadic species, their original homeworld forgotten, even to them. They cannot abide confinement and constraint, and they itch to move on shortly after they arrive in a new place. Due to their homelessness, musical talent, natural secrecy, and avoidance of written records, ryn developed a nomadic culture and a reputation for confidence games, leaving many species prejudiced against them. In some sectors it is legal to enslave or hunt ryn. Their language is outlawed in many locations, and a large number of ryn women are used as slave breeding stock. They claim that sabaac, the popular card game that took the place of Pazaak in terms of card game prominence, is derived from their use of it as a fortune telling tool in their auguries. These auguries are today favored by hutts, who have a superstitious belief in the card tellings.

The use of these claws in any form of combat or attack was considered dishonorable and a sign of madness; to do this was to give in to animal instincts unbecoming of a sentient species. Because of the Selkath’s water-dwelling nature, their chest armors were fitted with misting vents in order to keep their skin moist.\n\nSOCIETY &amp; CULTURE\nSelkath are native to the planet Manaan, the only naturally occurring source of the medical liquid referred to as kolto.

  <thing id="rPRSquib" name="Squib" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nSquibs are small, sentient, humanoid mammals with both rodent and canine characteristics. Their pink skin is covered in fur that offers some protection from cold weather, but, more importantly, it serves as an olfactory organ, able to pick up scents at a distance and ascertain intrinsic details�such as penetrating through a disguise or identifying a forgery�when rubbed against. The species has both male and female sexes, although non-Squibs often have difficulty determining the sex of a Squib based on appearance alone. Their mouths are full of forbidding, sharp, white teeth, and their flexible cheeks were capable of storing items.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nSquibs are friendly and cheerful to such an extent that, over time, they are considered quite annoying. Squibs are inherently curious, handling items with literal regard to care. They are unabashed pack rats, and they wear clothing for the excess storage rather than necessity. The Squibs’ overconfidence is a defining trait. The typical Squib response to a threat is not to fight or flee, but to bluff and bluster, especially when not face-to-face. In person, their sharp teeth are their favored means of intimidation. Squibs believe that bargaining is the highest form of communication, and they believe haggling is more important than the goods themselves. A deal is a binding oath to Squibs, and they are incredibly loyal to their business partners.\n\nNAMES\nSquibs combine their first and last names, which are familial, into one long, hyphenated name. They often go by nicknames derived from their full names. Male and female names do not significantly deviate.\n\nFull Names. Galaneever-marmalios, Meelawin-demort, Sleerinwilpher-remalior\n\nNicknames. Galan, Meela, Wilpher" compset="Race">

Their muscular forms combined with their powerful tails make them very agile hunters, and their colorfully-scaled hides have been proven to be resistant even to blaster bolts. From their nostrils, two scent-tongues protrude that grant them enhanced olfactory senses, compensating for the poor vision afforded them by their dark, three-lidded eyes. No Ssi-ruu has ever been known to be Force-sensitive.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe citizens of the Ssi-ruuvi Imperium follow a rigid caste system in which their station in society is determined by the color of the scales they are born with. Among these, the brown-scaled outcasts are regarded as the lowest of the low, and have no place in the Imperium beyond menial labor or death at birth. Deeply xenophobic and religious, the Ssi-ruuk view the rest of the galaxy as populated by lesser beings whose worlds rightfully belong to the Imperium. Despite their fierce nature, most ssi-ruuk are afraid of dying on a world unconsecrated by their priest caste, as they believe their souls would be doomed, so they harvest and “entech” the life-energy of other species to power droids that fight for them. The entechment process is torturous and painful to its victims, and is the main power source of Ssi-ruuvi technology.\n\nNAMES\nSsi-ruuvi names are difficult to pronounce and gender neutral.

Sullustans are distinguishable for their almond-shaped black eyes, facial jowls called dewflaps and large, round ears. Their wide earlobes provide excellent hearing, and their large eyes provide exceptional low-light vision. Due to their relative lack of exposure to natural light, Sullustans begin to suffer from corneal defects after 30 standard years. Many choose to wear special visors to prevent further damage.

Alternatively, during the deep darkness of their homeworld’s moonless night, the larger pair are utilized to provide the Talz with adequate vision. Talz use a small proboscis to eat and communicate, creating high-pitched chirps and buzzes.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nTalz are a hunter-gatherer, clan-based society. They work in unison, and treat the entire clan as one single familial entity. Resources on Ordo Plutonia are often scarce, which leads to warring among Talz tribes. However, the clans are adept at forming a unified front when they face a common enemy.\n\nTalz are large, brutal creatures and are often used as guards and enforcers.

This color-changing ability is useful for camouflage and communication, and the scales naturally repel heat. Some examples of colors they take on include being brown when calm and in a comfortable environment, or becoming red after extended exertion or when excited. Tarasins also have short spines that protrude from their forearms�known as a sa’tosin�which give the creatures the ability to sense the use of the Force. Tarasins are naturally curious and protective but also slow to anger. What they lack in sheer physical strength they make up for with a brilliant intellect.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nTarasins live in a tribal system in the jungle underbrush of Cularin, grouping together in clans called irstat. The tarasin believe they have a symbiotic relationship with Cularin, and their religion is based around the appreciation of the natural world. This closeness with their homeworld is what makes the tarasin reluctant to leave it for an extended time. The tarasin have a strong connection with the Force, and their spiritual leaders are often able to call upon the Force in small ways. The tarasin believe that the ch’hala tree is sacred.

They also possess four arms, with the upper set being stronger and larger. Each of their four hands have five fingers, and each finger is tipped with a long, sturdy claw. It is thought unsophisticated or unseemly by upper-class thisspiasians to have the bottom two visible in public, so they are generally hidden from sight via larger garments, with the smaller limbs sometimes even bound to their bodies. Thisspiasians need very little sleep to function normally, resting for only two hours a day, with brief meditative moments scattered throughout the day to refocus.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThisspiasian culture is one of proud warriors who keep their emotions well-concealed and their rages checked. Many outsiders see only a thisspiasian’s outward facade of tranquility, and to most being it seems as if thisspiasians existed in a sea of calm.

  <thing id="rPRTognath" name="Tognath" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nTognath are a sentient species native to Yar Togna. Yar Togna is a foul-smelling, high-gravity planet with a toxic, fume-saturated atmosphere. As a result, tognath wear a breathing apparatus to process the oxygen content in a planet’s atmosphere. The tognath have a striking look thanks to their insectoid and mammalian characteristics; another factor is their having both an endo- and exoskeleton. They also possess a very primitive nervous system, which provides them with immunity to most pain (a helpful trait in combat). Tognath begin life as larvae born from egg clutches hatched in a suspension jelly, and latch onto one of their parents, feeding directly from their bloodstream. While in that jelly, two or more eggs (not necessarily from the same parent) sometimes graft together, thus creating a bond that continues throughout the life of the eggmates. Six months later, parents visit a nursery tree, where the young detatch from them and spin a cocoon. Within, the offspring undergo a metamorphosis, developing both their skeletons to resist the high gravity and pressures of Yar Togna.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nTognath live in stilted homes with lava channels near the main mountain range of Yar Togna, where they have access to mountain springwater. Most of tognath society believes that mate selection and egg laying should occur late in life, after having dedicated most of one’s prime years to a career. This means that parents are generally retired and dote on their children relentlessly, often homeschooling them after their transformation.\n\nNAMES\nTognath use generally simple, nongendered names, without bothering with surnames.\n\nFirst Names.

They are large, heavy-framed bipeds, with retractable claws on their hands and feet. Female Togorians grow up to 7 feet tall, while adult males can reach up to 9 feet. They’re covered in gray-white, black, brown, or orange fur, often with colorful spots or stripes.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nTogorians have a unique cultural division between their sexes. They evolved as nomadic hunters of creatures like the bist and etelo, surviving on the wilderness as apex predators. As time went on, a rift in their society developed between the two sexes. Males were drawn to continue their lifestyle as nomads and hunters for their people, while females tended to prefer remaining in permanent camps and contributed the vast majority of their species technological developments. This division has continued into modern times, with males continuing their nomadic traditions and females frequently preferring to stay in villages and cities. Males visit their mates for about a month each year, but otherwise the sexes live completely separate lives. Whether in spite of this separation of the sexes, or because of it, Togorians are typically monogamous and devoted to their chosen mates.\n\nNAMES\nTogorian names tend to be short and primal-sounding. Female names tend to include softer consonants and more vowels, while male names are typically harsher. Togorians do not use surnames.\n\nMale Names.

  <thing id="rPRToydarian" name="Toydarian" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nA mammalian species of winged, stout bodied humanoids, the Toydarians have stubby facial tusks which protruded from their lower jaw and framed a short pudgy trunk. While their stubby legs can support their body weight, Toydarians’ primary mode of locomotion was their use of the wings on their upper back. Though their wings can beat as fast as ten times a second, the effort burned up large amounts of energy, causing the species to need to replenish itself often through regularly eating mass quantities of food. In order to fuel this hyperactive metabolism, Toydarians eat concentrated foods and egg-seeds. Most of the bloodiest wars in their history were fought over food supplies.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nDespite being ruled by the Hutts, the Toydarian people are able to govern themselves free of major outside intervention through the establishment of a feudal monarchy. A ruling king sits on the planet’s throne, allowing vassals to form allegiances and have minor disputes to solve their own problems. The king makes sure to keep his vassals happy and to have their allegiance, but will occasionally encourage infighting to reveal the true character of the vassals and weed out treachery.\n\nToydarians are known as shrewd businessmen.\n\nNAMES\nToydarian names are fairly simple and guttural, but a few harsher elements can be found here and there.

They notably eat genteslugs.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nUgnaughts are ruled by councils comprised of elected officers. Ugnaughts live their lives in accordance to their “blood profession”, with Ugnaught parents teaching their children their trade. Infant Ugnaughts are known as Ugletts. If the number of new Ugnaughts in a given profession exceeds the need, a blood duel is called. When the Ugnaughts reached their twentieth year of age, these fights are held to the death, with the victor winning the right to inherit their blood profession. Despite this outdated and violent custom, the Ugnaughts are generally a peaceful people with a rich culture.\n\nWhen greeting an Ugnaught, it is advised to bow silently, then wait for a guttural purring as a positive response.

As a result, Umbaran eyes are well-adjusted to seeing in low light, and can see into the ultraviolet spectrum, but can be disoriented by bright light.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nUmbaran society is strictly divided into a leveled caste system, with most Umbarans constantly scheming to improve their social rank, using tactics such as blackmail, subterfuege, and even assassination if necessary. Only those within the ten highest caste tiers were given opportunities to leave their homeworld. Because of the cutthroat machinations required to get there, Umbarans in the wider galaxy are known as skilled, ruthless politicians.

  <thing id="rPRVoss" name="Voss" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nVoss are humanoid sentients with a high rate of Force-sensitivity who display prominent sexual dimorphism. The male Voss have blue skin and bright orange eyes, while the females have red skin and azure eyes. The Voss do not have hair or distinct pupils, and posess unique patterns of markings on their face, neck, and body, a trace of their shared ancestry with Gormak. Their voices have a slight mechanical tinge to them, making them sound somewhat like a droid or machine. Voss undogo a physical, developmental change during their marriage ceremonies (known as the Rite of Ardor) and do not develop sexually prior to the performance of these rituals.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nThe Voss species resides in the isolated mountain-top city of Voss-Ka and is vastly outnumbered on their homeworld by its other native sentient species, the Gormak, who are extremely hostile toward them and from whom they arose. Most Voss live peacefully in Voss-Ka, caring for their families, cultivating the wild plants and maintaining equipment for the Voss commandos in the war against the Gormak, although some Voss do live outside the capital city, such as the Voss Mystics who reside in the Shrine of Healing. The Voss are great lovers of art, and their architecture features a distinctive artistic style. The entire Voss society is guided by the Force visions of Voss Mystics, which are considered infallible without exception.\n\nNAMES\nAll Voss have two short names, connected by a hyphen, with the family name being the second one.\n\nMale Names.

They have distinguishing gray-green, leathery skin. Being able to breathe both water and air, they are perfectly adapted to travel Sembla’s warm, shallow seas dotted with volcanic islands. They share a strong nomadic instinct with their amphibious ancestors.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nYoung Vurk males are married off by their parents; those who failed to marry before reaching adulthood remain bachelors for the rest of their lives. Because their way of living resulted in virtually no sizable permanent settlement whatsoever, Vurks were generally considered primitive by the rest of the galaxy; however, that was not true. They are very intelligent and believe in a highly developed philosophical tradition that emphasizes personal integrity and individual freedom and encourage personal honesty. Their compassionate and calm manner made them better than average diplomats.\n\nVurks are very family-oriented. It is common for multiple generations to remain in the same location as a single household, with the eldest family member being the patriarch or matriarch and making the decision for the entire family." compset="Race">

The species possesses six fingered hands that have retractable dewclaws. Each one is located on the inside of the wrist above their six-fingered hands. Their dewclaws shoot from a sheath of a skin beneath their cadaverous hands and are capable of being retracted. When extended fully, the wrist blades reach about a foot in length, and are used in close combat and blood sacrifices. The Yevetha also possess a greater tolerance for g-forces when compared to Human pilots.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nWithin their society, blood is an important aspect of their culture and is a central focus of their religious belief system. This has resulted in them becoming a particularly violent species. For the Yevetha, death is not to be feared. They are described as being dutiful, attentive, cautious but also fatalistic in their view of the universe. When fighting against other foes, Yevetha are notable for being ruthless fighters who never surrender even in the face of certain defeat. Due to the brutal nature of their society, the Yevetha do not possess a single jail, penitentiary or stockade as they believe there is no need for such facilities. In fact, they do not possess a word in their language for either convict or incarcerate.\n\nNAMES\nYevetha names are sharp and are kept to one syllable, not varying significantly based on gender.

  <thing id="rPRZeltron" name="Zeltron" description="BIOLOGY AND APPEARANCE\nZeltrons are one of the few near-human species that differentiated from the baseline stock enough to be considered a new species of the Human genus, rather than simply a subspecies. They possess two biological traits of note. The first is that they all produce potent pheromones, similar to the Falleen species, which enhanced their attractiveness and likeability. The second is a limited telepathic ability, used to project emotions onto others, as well as allowing them to read and even feel the emotions of others; some Zeltrons have been hired by the Exchange for this ability. Because of their telepathic ability, positive emotions such as happiness, love and pleasure are very important to them, while negative ones such as anger, fear, or depression are shunned.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nZeltron culture is highly influenced by sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure in general. Most of their art and literature is devoted to the subject, producing some of the raciest pieces in the galaxy. Zeltrons are known to dress in wildly colorful or revealing attire. It’s common to see Zeltrons wearing shockingly bright shades of neon colors in wildly designed bikinis, or nearly skin tight clothing of other sorts with bizarre color designs, patterns, and symbols.\n\nNAMES\nZeltron names often have an air of mystique to them, to evoke sensuality. For a Zeltron, a beautiful face is nothing without an equally beautiful name. It’s not uncommon for a Zeltron to forsake their familial surname in favor of a more attractive-sounding one.\n\nMale Names. Marruc, Bahb, Rahulh, Demagol\n\nFemale Names.

The Zygerrians’ faces and their pointed ears are almost entirely covered with fur; males usually have more hair than females, with bands of fur growing on their cheeks. Male Zygerrians also display a number of bony spurs protruding from the chin, which females typically lack. Zygerrians usually have sallow complexions and are physically strong, but some suffer from obesity.\n\nSOCIETY AND CULTURE\nA warlike species, the Zygerrians hold strength�both physical and mental�in great esteem, viewing it as a means to gain power and authority. They believe that it is the natural order of life for the strong to dominate the weak, so slavery is normal for the species, and a display of weakness could mean death or enslavement in their culture. Those who become their slaves are viewed as inferior by the Zygerrians.\n\nZygerrian society is organized into clans and classes. They have a noble class, many members of which, despite their high status, pursue a career in the military. The Zygerrian government is a monarchy; female rulers hold the title of Queen, and males are addressed as Kings.\n\nThe center of the Zygerrian society is the Zygerrian Slavers Guild, which focuses on the slave trade in the Outer Rim Territories.\n\nNAMES\nZygerrian names are rather diverse, though shorter names are the most common.
